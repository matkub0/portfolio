## About me

I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for ensuring software quality. I am motivated to continuously develop professionally and eagerly learn new tools and methodologies related to software testing.
The career path I want to follow is automated testing, so I am constantly trying to expand my knowledge with new freamwork and improving good testing practices. I also get involved with security and performance testing by developing my knowledge in tools such as JMeter and Burp Suite. Continuous development and new challenges are what motivate me to keep working.
