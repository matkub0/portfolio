## About me

I am a student in my last semester at the Bialystok University of Technology, studying Management in extramural mode. My first commercial experience was gained as a junior engineer in the quality assurance department, where I worked on two different projects. The career path that I would like to continue in the future is in the automated testing field. I am ready for new challenges and determined to acquire new knowledge. Outside of work, I am constantly improving my knowledge of programming languages and devoting time to my other interests such as computer and board games, strength training and cycling trips.
